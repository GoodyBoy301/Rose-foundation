          Mrs. Onwurah is a widow, whose husband was buried in January, 2022.
          After the burial, her late husband’s siblings demanded that she hands
          over all the documents of her late husband’s properties to them.

        <p className='text-[25px] font-[400] mt-4'>
          She reported to Rose Foundation. The Foundation stepped in and
          resolved the matter through Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR). Mrs.
          Onwurah was granted total ownership of her late husband’s properties.
